Stuff I am adding:

* [X] Address table manipulation using basic hex math, i.e. adjust all addresses by value and allow per-record offset
* [ ] Hex calculator
* [X] Pretty print JSON emitted files
* [ ] Put field names in saved table JSON
* [ ] Add boundaries to allow searching for values within specific regions/ranges
* [X] Command line and environment variable support for attaching to process and opening table (TODO: only partly done)
* [ ] Configurable value displays, i.e. rounding decimals or how much of a string to display
* [ ] Relative address logic: Add "@parent" and "@previous" tags to be able to make relative entries, so "@parent+8E" would evaluate out to the parent address plus 8E. Needs a bit of definition around cases.
* [ ]
